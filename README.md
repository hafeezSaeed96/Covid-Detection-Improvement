# Covid-Detection-Improvement

This project estimates the potential of Traditional Geometrical Data Augmentation (TGA) techniques to enhance the classification accuracy of COVID-net model over
unbalanced chest x-ray (CXR) images dataset. In the light of achieved results, it has been proved that TGA techniques help improve the modelâ€™s classification
performance for COVID-19 virus. In the end, the report also presents potential improvement suggestions for the COVID-net model regarding the way dataset
could be augmented better.
